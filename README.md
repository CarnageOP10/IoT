IoT Projects Repository
Welcome to the IoT Projects Repository! This repository contains three distinct projects showcasing various applications of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Each project focuses on different aspects of IoT, ranging from controlling actuators through a locally hosted web server to developing a comprehensive hazard detection system for mine workers.

Project 1: Controlling Actuators via Locally Hosted Web Server
In this project, we demonstrate how to control actuators using a locally hosted web server. The code provides a simple yet effective interface to manipulate connected actuators through a web browser. Explore the 'Actuator_Control' directory for implementation details.

Project 2: Smart Energy Meter using ZMPT and ACS Sensor with Adafruit
This project revolves around building a smart energy meter using ZMPT and ACS sensors. The code is designed to measure and monitor energy consumption efficiently. The 'Smart_Energy_Meter' directory contains the source code and documentation for this project.

Project 3: Smart IoT Helmet for Mine Workers
Comprehensive Hazard Detection System with Enhanced Functionality
This project focuses on ensuring the safety of mine workers through a comprehensive hazard detection system. The 'Smart_IoT_Helmet' directory encompasses the following features:

Google Assistant Integration: Users can interact with the helmet using voice commands through Google Assistant.

Real-Time Monitoring using Adafruit Industries Dashboard: The system provides real-time data monitoring through integration with the Adafruit Industries Dashboard.

Email-based Alert System: Receive email alerts in case of undesirable circumstances or hazardous situations, ensuring prompt response and intervention.
